## Description

 The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

## Table of Contents

## Installation

 The object and array literal expressions provide an easy way to create ad hoc packages of data.

## Usage

 The destructuring assignment uses similar syntax, but on the left-hand side of the assignment to define what values to unpack from the sourced variable.

## Contribution

 This capability is similar to features present in languages such as Perl and Python.
